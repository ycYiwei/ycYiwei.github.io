Hello! My name is Yiwei Cao and I am a final-year undergraduate student at McGill University, majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in Computer Science. My research interest pertains to both human and machine intelligence. More specifically, I am interested in using artificial intelligence methods to study human cognition, as well as applying insights from neuroscience and psychology to develop better AI (an approach often referred to as Neuro-AI).
